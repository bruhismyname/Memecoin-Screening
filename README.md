# MemecoinScreening 🚀

A Python-based algorithmic trading bot for scalping memecoins on the Solana blockchain. This bot utilizes key technical indicators such as **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)**, **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**, and **Bollinger Bands** to make high-frequency trades in a volatile crypto market.

## Features ✨
- **EMA Crossover Strategy:** Uses EMA-9 and EMA-21 to detect bullish/bearish trends.
- **RSI Analysis:** Identifies overbought and oversold conditions to avoid bad trades.
- **Bollinger Bands:** Measures market volatility and identifies potential breakout points.
- **Dynamic Order Execution:** Automatically places buy/sell orders based on real-time conditions.
- **Scalping Optimization:** Designed for low-latency trading to maximize small profits over short timeframes.

## Installation 🛠️

  ```sh
  pip install pandas numpy requests
  ```

## Strategy Explanation 📈
- **Buy Signal:** When EMA-9 crosses above EMA-21 and RSI is above 30.
- **Sell Signal:** When EMA-9 crosses below EMA-21 or RSI is above 70.
- **Bollinger Bands:** If the price touches the lower band, a reversal may occur; touching the upper band may indicate overbought conditions.
